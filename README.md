## Summary

This project was created to create a backend for an already created front end. Taking code that was written, we used preset URL endpoints to create CRUD operations in our server backend to retrieve data, create posts to a site, and delete posts based on a unique ID generated by a helper function. We were able to push the completed application to a heroku server service to deploy our backend.

## Demonstration

## Description

A web application that allows users to create notes and store them on the page. When a note is created, the title of the note shows up on the left column of the page and when clicked that note will show up as a read only file on main page. If the delete button is pressed, the user will see that the selected file will be deleted from the sidebar.

## Code Snippet

### gets the homepage and the notes page and displays them to the root url and /notes url endpoints

```JavaScript
app.get("/", (req, res) =>
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "/public/index.html"))
);

//get request for the endpoint of /api/notes that loads the notes.html file
app.get("/notes", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "/public/notes.html"));
});
```

### Post request on the server side

```JavaScript
app.post("/api/notes", (req, res) => {
  console.info(`${req.method} request received`);

  const { title, text } = req.body;

  if (title && text) {
    const newNote = {
      title,
      text,
      id: uuid(),
    };
    //pulls the data from the db.json file and pushes the new note to the database as long as all the information has been filled in.
    fs.readFile("./db/db.json", "utf8", (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(err);
      } else {
        const fileData = JSON.parse(data);
        fileData.push(newNote);
        noteStorage = fileData;
        //writes the file back to the database file with it in the array
        fs.writeFile(
          "./db/db.json",
          JSON.stringify(fileData, null, 4),
          (writeErr) =>
            writeErr
              ? console.error(writeErr)
              : console.info("Successfully updated notes!")
        );
      }
    });
    //creates a response object that returns a status and a body of newNote.
    const response = {
      status: "success",
      body: newNote,
    };

    console.log(response);
    res.json(response);
  } else {
    res.json("Error in posting notes");
  }
});
```
